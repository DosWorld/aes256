# A byte-oriented AES-256 implementation

As you may know, I do cryptographic perversions occasionally.
 
Recently, I've been asked for a compact implementation of AES-256.
Code size must be small; speed is not critical, and (here is the catch)
no assembly language. The requesters have tried various public available
implementations before, and none were fit.

So I did mine, and here it is.

This is a straightforward and somewhat na√Øve byte-oriented portable
C implementation, where all the lookup tables are replaced with on-the-fly
calculations. Indeed, it is slower and more subjective to side-channel
attacks by nature. But this implementation is what was precisely wanted,
and it made everybody happy.
 
Note it is AES-256, not AES-128. This implementation is fully compatible
with FIPS-197. The included demo code validates with the test vector as
defined in Appendix C.3.

I have updated the source code; thanks to [Hal Finney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Finney_(computer_scientist))
for his valuable input. The decryption routine is faster, so this
implementation is better for generic use. Now you may also choose
between using dynamic or pre-computed tables when compiling.
